# TODO:
# This role will assume the tasks that are currently done in prepd.rb, e.g. encrypting credentials, decrypting and processing credentials

# See this page for using gpg-agent for ansible vault: https://blog.erincall.com/p/using-pgp-to-encrypt-the-ansible-vault

# 1) manage credentials
# - cloud api keys
# - ssh keys
# - certificates

# 2) manage configuration:
# When a new host is provisioned with a new key then:
# - .ssh/config needs to be updated
# - inventory_hosts: the ansible_ssh_private_key value needs to be updated

# 3) process credentials
# - credentials/terraform/default.tfvars needs to be generated
# - write the AWS CSV files into yml in prepd/credentials/aws/*.yml

# Maybe change this role name from prepd to credentials or make this a sub-role, e.g. prepd/credentials

# NOTE: $AWS_PROFILE is used to specify account to access the tf bucket
# The tfvars file still needs to be used to specifiy different AWS accounts for the acutal plan apply
